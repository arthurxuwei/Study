最近用idea发现一个提示：
field injection is not recommend
然后查找结果：
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/39890849/what-exactly-is-field-injection-and-how-to-avoid-it
大致内容：
1.注入三种类型： 1.constructor 2.setter 3.field (like @Autowired)
2.注入使用指导： 对于mandatory或者aiming for mutability，使用（1），
                 对于optional或者changeable依赖，使用
                 尽量避免使用（3）
3.field injection 缺点
1)You cannot create immutable objects as with constructor injection
2)Your classes have tight coupling with DI container and cannot be used outside of it
3）Your classes cannot be instantiated (for example in unit tests) without reflection, 
you need DI container to instantiate them, which is more like integration tests
4）Your real dependencies are hidden from the outside and are not reflected in your interface - constructors or methods
It is really easy to have like 10 dependencies. If you were using constructor injection, 
having constructor with 10 arguments will signal that something is fishy. But you can add 
injected fields using field injection indefinitely. Having too many dependencies is a red 
flag that the class usually does more than one thing and it may be a violation of a 
Single Responsibility Principle.
