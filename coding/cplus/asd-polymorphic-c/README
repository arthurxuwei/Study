Structured C code example, demonstrating polymorphic objects in C.

Build
 * 'make' to build the executable, named 'geo-project'
 * 'make clean' to delete all the object files and rebuild (no dependency detection !)
 * 'make cleaner' to clean-up the project completly

Things to try
 * in 'Main.c', comment/uncomment line 16 or 17, and see what happens.
