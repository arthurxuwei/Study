Essntial Paxos provides basic implementations of the Paxos algorithm. The
distinguishing characteristic of this implementations, as compared to 
other freely available and open-source implementations, is that this library
is  independent of application domains and networking infrastructures. 
Whereas most Paxos implementations are deeply and inextricably embedded 
within application-specific logic, this implementation focuses on encapsulating
the Paxos algorithm within opaque and easily re-usable classes.

This library provides an algorithmically correct Paxos implementation that
may be used for educational purposes in addition to direct use in networked
applications. this implementation is specifically designed to facilitate
understanding of both the essential Paxos algorithm as well as the practical
considerations that must be taken into account for real-world use.
